            <h3>terms & conditions</h3>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us and we believe it is important for you to know what personal data we,Skylark(“Skylark” or “we”), collect from you (and third parties), why we collect it, how we use it and what rights you might be entitled to as a data subject or consumer.

            Please note: all information in this privacy notice is applicable to you unless otherwise indicated based on your residency status. For the additional terms which may be applicable to you based on your residency status, please refer to your country-specific terms at the end of this notice. In this notice, term “personal data” is used to represent any information relating to an identified or identifiable person; country-specific notices might adopt a different terminology.
                
            We encourage you to read this notice, together with any additional and more specific information we may provide to you on various occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data on Skylark websites, products or applications, events and initiatives so that you are aware of how and the purpose for which we are processing your personal data.Privacy policies are legally required under most countries’ legislations. They protect and inform your users and declare your compliance with applicable privacy laws in a legally binding way. While they do give you some leeway in terms of stating things such as how you handle “do not track” requests, they are generally aimed at protecting the user (more in our Legal Requirements Overview).
            Terms and conditions are aimed at protecting the business (you). They give business owners the opportunity to set their rules (within applicable law) of how their service or product may be used including, but not limited to, things like copyright conditions, age limits, and the governing law of the contract. While terms are generally not legally required (like the privacy policy), it is essential for protecting your interests as a business owner.</p>
